          The F Word attempts to illustrate sentiment in the AAPI community on feminism and intersectionality. The ideas presented here are inspired by "The F Word: Let's Talk AAPI Feminism & Intersectionality", a workshop hosted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uiucapac/" target="_blank">APAC</a> in the 2017 Spring semester. The original data was collected, organized, and provided by <a href="" target="_blank">Katrina Montreal</a>.
